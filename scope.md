# Keryu - Subject Management System

## Project Overview
Keryu is a comprehensive subject management system designed to help track and manage subjects with their associated QR codes and alarms. The system provides features for both administrators and custodians to manage subjects, generate QR codes, and monitor alarms.

Example of one case (among others) where Keryu is helpful:
A parent of a child is letting them go to the zoo with their school mates (and teachers). If the child gets lost and someone finds them, that person can scan the QR code on the child's badge. The parent (custodian) immediately receives a WhatsApp message with the alarm details. From there, the parent can contact the teacher to check the situation.

To use the system, the parent needs to:
1. Sign up in Keryu
2. Create a subject record with their child's data
3. Generate and print the QR code
4. Attach the QR code to the child's badge or belongings

Examples of Subjects that can be tracked:
- Children
- Elderly people
- Persons with disabilities

## Core Features

### Subject Management
