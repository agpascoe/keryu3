This will be a full stack system for taking care of vulnerable people (old people and children, called subject for simplicity), the basic initial idea is to have a database with the personal data of those people, parents or custodians, including the whatsapp number, doctors, hospital in case of an accident, and other useful). the custodian(s) is who subscribe (create) the subject and update any data. Once subscribed, the system creates a QR code for being printed in a credential for example, which will be used for reporting any possible accident or issue with the subject. In case of an issue, any person can read the QR and an alarm will be switched on in the web app, as well as a message in whats app to the custodians. I want this system will be written in django for the back and front in web. I need that this system use API REST communication and the QR-alarm will be implemented as an API call. Also the whatsApp message should be implemented as APIs calls.
