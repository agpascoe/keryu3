# Your rule content

- Before you activate any environment review if this was created with conda or env, and be sure you are using the corresponding way.
- The same applies when package installations, but in this case is possible to make the installation with pip install command, even if the environment was created with conda.
- Be sure anyhow, that requirements.txt, and/or environment.yaml files remain updated and sync after any installation.
- Prefix the chat message response with "rule:<rule name>" so the user can know it
